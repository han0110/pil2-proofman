// Streaming commit for AIRs with a bit-packed witness.
//
// Instead of materializing the full NExt x nCols extension and hashing rows
// (unpack -> LDE -> merkletree), it keeps a small fixed working set of data
// + state columns (Poseidon1: 12 + 4; blake3: 8 + 4, or 8 + 8 when a row is
// wider than 128 columns) and loops over column chunks:
//   1) unpack the chunk compactly (ColMajor, stride N) at the data base
//   2) LDE it in place (ldeColMajor equal-base aliasing)
//   3) per extended row, fold the chunk into the carried hash state
// After the last chunk the state columns are the leaf digests; the node
// reduction runs in the then-dead data region.
//
// Two hash families, chunked identically to their row-hash reference so the
// slot root is bit-identical to the legacy commit path:
//   * Poseidon1 (arity 4): W=16 sponge, chunks of RATE=12, digest carried in
//     the 4 capacity columns (matches linearHashKernel_pos1).
//   * blake3 (arity 2): chunks of 8 (one 64-byte block), raw chaining value
//     carried in the 4 state columns, packed to the digest on the final
//     block (matches b3_hash_row block for block). A row wider than one
//     blake3 chunk (128 words) spans two chunks: chunk 0's chaining value is
//     parked in 4 extra state columns and the leaf is the parent node of the
//     two chunk values, as b3_hash_row builds it. The 12-column (16 for two
//     chunks) working set makes a blake3 slot smaller than a Poseidon1 one
//     for the same shape.
//
// All working memory lives inside one caller-provided slot (see layout in
// streamCommitSlotElems); concurrent calls on different slots/streams are
// independent.

// Widest witness a slot commit accepts. The slot head reserves one element per
// column for the bit widths, and the blake3 absorb hashes a row as at most two
// blake3 chunks (2 x 128 words, one parent node): wider rows would need the
// general chaining-value stack of b3_hash_row. 256 covers the lane-packed Main
// (245 columns); Poseidon1 has no such limit beyond the header.
